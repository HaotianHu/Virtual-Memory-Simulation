Note: My second project for CS143B is written by Python3 language under Mac OS environment, please make sure that your operating system has installed Python3.6.

Instruction:

1. Open 'Terminal' on mac, go to the directory of my project.
   (You will see a file named Virtual_Memory.py)
   e.g: The Folder of my project folder(named 143B_PROJECT2) is in the path--Desktop,
	in Terminal, cd to desktop and cd to folder 143B_PROJECT2

2. In Terminal, type "python3 Virtual_Memory.py" and press enter. 

3. After step 2:
   a) The terminal will prompt "Enter the init file's path:", type the "absolute path of
      the initialization file", and press enter 
   b) Then the terminal will prompt "Enter the input file's path:", type the "absolute
      path of the input file", and press enter 

4. If above steps are correct, you could see the the terminal prompts "The output file has 
   correctly created under the same path of this python file."

5. At this time, you could check the output file in the current directory(same directory 
   folder of 'Virtual_Memory.py'.)
